# How to Become a Master of Programming

> A learning journey by Chris Enytc <chris@enytc.com>

## Introduction

This guide has the purpose of orientating those who wish to pursue a self-taught software engineering career. This guide was made especially for my wife and anyone with the same desire to learn a new skill and help humanity.

### Information about the length of the journey

This journey will take one year to be fully completed. It will be divided into four cycles of three months.

### Information on the contents of the journey

You will be required to read books and articles along the way. You will also be required to solve some proposed problems and build projects to showcase your acquired knowledge.
